# Customer_churn_pipeline
The goal of this project is to build a robust data pipeline and machine learning model to predict customer churn using multi-source data. The system enables companies to proactively identify high-risk customers and implement timely retention strategies.
Perfect! Since you already have **input/output files for each step**, I’ll draft a detailed **project description** that you can include in your **LinkedIn**, **GitHub README**, or even as part of a portfolio.

Here’s a full description explaining each phase of the **Customer Churn Prediction** project, including **inputs, processing, and outputs**:

- Aggregated metrics (total purchases, avg. billing)
- Categorical encoding
- Date differences (e.g., days since last login)

**📤 Output:**
- Final feature set: `features.csv`

---

### **5. Model Building**
**📥 Inputs:**
- Engineered feature set

**🤖 Tasks:**
- Splitting data into train/test

**📊 Metrics Evaluated:**
- AUC-ROC
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Model calibration curve

**📤 Output:**
- Evaluation report: `model_evaluation.txt`
- Visualizations in `plots/`

---

### **7. Model Interpretation**
**📥 Inputs:**
- Trained model and feature set

**🧠 Tasks:**
- Feature importance ranking
- SHAP/Permutation importance
- Interpretation of top churn drivers

**📤 Output:**
- Explainability report: `feature_importance.csv`
- SHAP visualizations

---

### **8. Deployment Readiness**
**📥 Inputs:**
- Final model and pre-processing pipeline

**⚙️ Tasks:**
- Build a pipeline for new data scoring
- Save model artifacts and versioning
- Write an inference script

**📤 Output:**
- `predict.py`: Inference script
- `requirements.txt`: Environment dependencies
- Folder structure: `models/`, `src/`, `data/`

---

### 🎯 Final Outcome
